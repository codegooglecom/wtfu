A simple utility which allows you automatically rename your existing files (or create hard links) using names specified in torrent file.

If you have some content and wish to join to existing seeding on some BitTorrent tracker, you cannot do this while files in torrent file differs from files you have in names.

If you edit the torrent file, you still cannot join seeding, since names affect info hash (tracker would not be able to recognize this torrent).

There are two solutions to this problem. The first is to rename your files. And the second is to create hard links (alternative name for existing file).

This utility will help you to do this automatically.
